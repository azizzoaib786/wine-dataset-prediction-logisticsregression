# Wine Class Prediction using Logistics Regression and Feature Engineering (Lasso Regularization)

It consists of seen and unseen data, modelling & training will be performed on seen data and applied on unseen data to predict the target variable which is class of wine.

## Steps

1. Data Preparations
2. Data Plotting to see any trends
3. Data Splitting into Test/Train
4. Apply Logistics Regression model on seen data without feature engineering (returns overfit result with accuracy of 1)
5. Apply Feature Engineering using Lasso regularization to extract important features required for prediction
6. Apply Logistics Regression model again on seen data with feature engineering to see the results
7. Provide some justifications on Bias and Variance based on the results
8. Finally apply the trained model on the unseen data and get the predicted output
